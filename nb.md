## Structure

Structure should be simple enough, but have enough separation of concern.
Ideally:
 - No more than 2 sub folders, too many is confusing
 - Has some kind of ID, to prevents things moving around too much when notes grow
    - johnnydecimal.com
    - timestamp?

For now the category would be:
- inbox: random things, default & unorganized notes stored here
- project: both personal and work?
- reference: specifically for paper reading 
- life: journal, daily todos, goal, health, etc

Apart from life, everything can be managed in a single repo
